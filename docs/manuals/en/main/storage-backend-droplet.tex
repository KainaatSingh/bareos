The \package{bareos-storage-droplet} backend (\sinceVersion{sd}{Droplet}{17.2.7}) can be used to access Object Storage through \package{libdroplet}.
Droplet support a number of backends, most notably S3.
For details about Droplet itself see \externalReferenceDroplet.

\subsection{Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The Bareos package \package{bareos-storage-droplet} is not available on all platforms. Please refer to \nameref{sec:packages}.
  \item Droplet S3:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The droplet S3 can only be used with virtual-hosted-style buckets like \url{http://<bucket>.<s3_server>/object}.
        Path-style buckets are not supported.
        It has  been tested successfully with AWS S3 and CEPH Object Gateway S3.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Installation}

Install the package \package{bareos-storage-droplet} including its requirements
by using an appropriate package management tool
(eg. \command{yum}, \command{zypper}).





\subsection{Configuration}
The droplet backend requires a \bareosDir \nameref{DirectorResourceStorage}, a \bareosSd \nameref{StorageResourceDevice} as well as a Droplet profile file where your access-- and secret--keys and other parameters for the connection to your object storage are stored.

\subsubsection{AWS S3}
\label{sec:DropletAwsS3}

\subsubsubsection{Director}

First, we will create the new \bareosDir \nameref{DirectorResourceStorage}.

For the following example, we
\begin{itemize}
  \item choose the name \resourcename{Dir}{Storage}{S3_Object}.
  \item choose \resourceDirectiveValue{Dir}{Storage}{Media Type}{S3_Object1}. We name it this way, in case we later add more separated Object Storages that don't have access to the same volumes.
  \item assume the \bareosSd is located on the host \host{bareos-sd.example.com} and will offers the \nameref{StorageResourceDevice} \resourcename{Sd}{Device}{S3_ObjectStorage} (to be configured in the next section).
\end{itemize}

\begin{bareosConfigResource}{bareos-dir}{storage}{S3\_Object}
Storage {
    Name = "S3_Object"
    Address  = "bareos-sd.example.com"
    Password = "secret"
    Device = "AWS_S3_1-00"
    Media Type = "S3_Object1"
}
\end{bareosConfigResource}

These credentials are only used to connect to the \bareosSd. The credentials to access the object store (e.g. S3) are stored in the \bareosSd Droplet Profile.



\subsubsubsection{Storage Daemon}


As of your \bareosSd configuration, we need to setup a new device that acts as a link to Object Storage backend.

The name and media type must correspond to those settings in the \bareosDir \nameref{DirectorResourceStorage}:

\begin{itemize}
        \item \linkResourceDirective{Sd}{Device}{Name} = \linkResourceDirective{Dir}{Storage}{Device}
        \item \linkResourceDirective{Sd}{Device}{Media Type} = \linkResourceDirective{Dir}{Storage}{Media Type}
\end{itemize}

A device for the usage of AWS S3 object storage with a bucket named \path|backup-bareos| located in EU West 2, would look like this:

\begin{bareosConfigResource}{bareos-sd}{device}{AWS\_S3\_1-00}
Device {
  Name = "AWS_S3_1-00"
  Media Type = "S3_Object1"
  Archive Device = "AWS S3 Storage"
  Device Type = droplet
  Device Options = "profile=/etc/bareos/bareos-sd.d/droplet/aws.profile.conf,bucket=backup-bareos,location=eu-west-2,chunksize=100M"
  LabelMedia = yes                    # Lets Bareos label unlabeled media
  Random Access = yes
  AutomaticMount = yes                # When device opened, read it
  RemovableMedia = no
  AlwaysOpen = no
  Maximum File Size = 500M            # 500 MB (allows for seeking to small portions of the Volume)
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 1
  Maximum Spool Size = 15000M
}
\end{bareosConfigResource}



In these examples all the backup data is placed in the \path|bareos-backup| bucket on the defined S3 storage.
In contract to other \bareosSd backends, a Bareos volume is not represented by a single file.
Instead a volume is a sub-directory in the defined bucket
and every chunk is placed in the volume directory with the filename 0000-9999
and a size that is defined in the chunksize.
It is implemented this way, as S3 only allows reading full files,
so every append operation could result in reading the full volume file again.

Following \linkResourceDirective{Sd}{Device}{Device Options} settings are possible:

\begin{description}
\item[profile] Droplet profile path (e.g. /etc/bareos/bareos-sd.d/droplet/droplet.profile). Make sure the profile file is readable for user \user{bareos}.
\item[location] Optional, but required for AWS Storage (e.g. eu-west-2 etc.)
\item[acl] Canned ACL
\item[storageclass] Storage Class to use.
\item[bucket] Bucket to store objects in.
\item[chunksize] Size of Volume Chunks (default = 10 Mb)
\item[iothreads] Number of IO-threads to use for uploads (if not set, blocking uploads are used)
\item[ioslots] Number of IO-slots per IO-thread (default 10). Set this to $>=$ 1 for cached and to 0 for direct writing.
\item[retries] Number of writing tries before discarding a job. Set this to 0 for unlimited retries. Setting anything $!=$ 0 here will cause dataloss if the backend is not available, so be very careful.
\item[mmap] Use mmap to allocate Chunk memory instead of malloc().
\end{description}


Create the Droplet profile to be used.
This profile is used later by the droplet library when accessing your cloud storage.

An example for AWS S3 could look like this:

\begin{bareosConfigResource}{bareos-sd}{droplet}{aws.profile}
use_https = false               # Default is false, if set to true you may use the SSL parameters given in the droplet configuration wiki, see below.
host = s3.amazonaws.com         # This parameter is only used as baseurl and will be prepended with bucket and location set in device ressource to form correct url
access_key = myaccesskey
secret_key = mysecretkey
pricing_dir = ""                # If not empty, an droplet.csv file will be created which will record all S3 operations.
backend = s3
aws_auth_sign_version = 4       # Currently, AWS S3 uses version 4. The Ceph S3 gateway uses version 2.
\end{bareosConfigResource}


More arguments and the SSL parameters can be found in the documentation of the droplet library:
\url{https://github.com/scality/Droplet/wiki/Configuration-File}

\subsubsection{CEPH Object Gateway S3}

Please note, that there is also the \nameref{SdBackendRados} backend,
which can backup to CEPH directly. However, currently (17.2.7) the \sdBackend{Droplet}{S3} is known to outperform the \sdBackend{Rados}{} backend.

While parameters have been explained in the \nameref{sec:DropletAwsS3} section, this gives an example about how to backup to a CEPH Object Gateway S3.

\begin{bareosConfigResource}{bareos-dir}{storage}{S3\_Object}
Storage {
    Name = "S3_Object"
    Address  = "bareos-sd.example.com"
    Password = "secret"
    Device = "CEPH_1-00"
    Media Type = "S3_Object1"
}
\end{bareosConfigResource}


A device for CEPH object storage could look like this:
\begin{bareosConfigResource}{bareos-sd}{device}{CEPH\_1-00}
Device {
  Name = "CEPH_1-00"
  Media Type = "S3_Object1"
  Archive Device = "Object S3 Storage"
  Device Type = droplet
  Device Options = "profile=/etc/bareos/bareos-sd.d/droplet/ceph.profile,bucket=backup-bareos,chunksize=100M"
  LabelMedia = yes                    # Lets Bareos label unlabeled media
  Random Access = yes
  AutomaticMount = yes                # When device opened, read it
  RemovableMedia = no
  AlwaysOpen = no
  Maximum File Size = 500M            # 500 MB (allows for seeking to small portions of the Volume)
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 1
  Maximum Spool Size = 15000M
}
\end{bareosConfigResource}


And for CEPH it would be:
\begin{bareosConfigResource}{bareos-sd.d}{droplet}{ceph.profile}
use_https = false
host = CEPH-host.example.com
access_key = myaccesskey
secret_key = mysecretkey
pricing_dir = ""
backend = s3
aws_auth_sign_version = 2
\end{bareosConfigResource}

Main differences are, that a location is not required and in the profile, \path|aws_auth_sign_version = 2| instead of 4.


\subsection{Troubleshooting}

\hide{
\subsubsection{S3 Backend Unreachable}

The droplet device can run in two modes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item direct writing \path|(iothreads  = 0)|
    \item cached writing \path|(iothreads >= 1)|
\end{itemize}

If \path|iothreads >= 1, retries = 0| (unlimited retries) and the \sdBackend{Droplet}{} (e.g. S3 storage) is not available, a job will continue running until the backend problem is fixed.
If this is the case and the job is canceled, it will only be canceled on the Director. It continues running on the Storage Daemon, until the S3 backend is available again or the Storage Daemon itself is restarted.

If \path|iothreads >= 1, retries != 0| and the droplet backend (e.g. S3 storage) is not available, write operation will be silently discarded after the specified number of retries.

\warning{This combination of option is dangerous. Don't use it.}

%Caching when S3 backend is not available:
%This behaviour have not changed, but I fear problems can arise, if the backend is not available and all write operations are stored in memory.
}

\subsubsection{iothreads}

For testing following \linkResourceDirective{Sd}{Device}{Device Options} should be used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \path|iothreads=0|
    \item \path|retries=1|
\end{itemize}

If the S3 backend becomes or is unreachable, the storage daemon will behave depending on \argument{iothreads} and \argument{retries}.
When the storage daemon is using cached writing (\argument{iothreads}$>=1$) and \argument{retries} is set to zero (unlimited tries), the job will continue running until the backend becomes available again. The job cannot be canceled in this case, as the storage daemon will continuously try to write the cached files.

Great caution should be used when using \argument{retries} > 0 combined with cached writing. If the backend becomes unavailable and the storage daemon reaches the predefined tries, the job will be discarded silently yet marked as \path|OK| in the \bareosDir.

You can always check the status of the writing process by using \bcommand{status}{storage=...}. The current writing status will be displayed then:
\begin{bconsole}{status storage}
...
Device "S3_ObjectStorage" (S3) is mounted with:
    Volume:      Full-0085
    Pool:        Full
    Media type:  S3_Object1
Backend connection is working.
Inflight chunks: 2
Pending IO flush requests:
   /Full-0085/0002 - 10485760 (try=0)
   /Full-0085/0003 - 10485760 (try=0)
   /Full-0085/0004 - 10485760 (try=0)
...
Attached Jobs: 175
...

\end{bconsole}
\argument{Pending IO flush requests} means that there is data to be written. \argument{try}=0 means that this is the first try and no problem has occurred. If \argument{try} $>0$, problems occurred and the storage daemon will continue trying.

Status without pending IO chunks:
\begin{bconsole}{status storage}
...
Device "S3_ObjectStorage" (S3) is mounted with:
    Volume:      Full-0084
    Pool:        Full
    Media type:  S3_Object1
Backend connection is working.
No Pending IO flush requests.

\end{bconsole}


\subsubsection{AWS S3 Logging}

If you use AWS S3 object storage and want to debug your bareos setup, it is recommended to turn on the server access logging in your bucket properties. You will see if bareos gets to try writing into your bucket or not.
